We developed, in an original way, a **Methodology** based on concepts extracted from Systems Theories.

In the complex world in which we live, we consider systemic thinking as the most effective approach to gaining a deep understanding of a particular theme or problem, identifying its causes, and finding points of intervention that offer great opportunities for change. Our Methodology promotes this through the following actions:

1. Drawing Systemic Maps[^1];
2. Identify Leveraging Points of Systemic ChangeÂ² from the Map[^2];
3. Catalyze Systemic Changes through the following actions:
	* Dissemination and deepening of Maps and Leverage Points;
	* Articulation of actors to implement leverage points;
	* Qualification in Systemic Thinking;
	* Consulting for implementation of Leverage Points.


[^1]: **Systemic map:** A graphical model that represents, in a simplified way, the reality of a complex system, including measurable sets, processes, flows and actors.

[^2]: **Systemic Leverage Points:** They are points within a system - a corporation, an economy, a living body, an electoral system, an ecosystem - where a small but precise change in something can produce great transformations in everything.
