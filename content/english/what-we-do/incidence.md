Our projects always involve the production of personalized content and communication strategies with interest groups, such as decision makers and influencers in the researched topics. Based on our extensive contact network, we will hold meetings and presentations to influence them in the adoption of systemic change strategies proposed in our Research and White Papers. In addition, we also develop technological platforms in partnership with other actors, whenever this shows a relevant strategy of incidence and systemic transformation.
