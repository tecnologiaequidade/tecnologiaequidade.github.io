The bots are out there and few know how they work, who develops them and by whom they are financed. The *PegaBot* platform aims to help combat this problem and make the debate on bots in Brazil more transparent and informed. *PegaBot* is a project of the Institute of Technology and Society of Rio de Janeiro (ITS Rio) and the Technology & Equity Institute (T&EI), developed by AppCívico.

> In this platform, the user can check the probability of a social network profile being controlled by a bot. For now, the platform is integrated with Twitter, but will soon be integrated with other social medias.

The project was built from the Botometer platform, created by the Indiana University Network Science Institute (IUNI) and Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research (CNetS). The *PegaBot* team worked and increased the open source code and trained it for analysis in Pt-Br.
