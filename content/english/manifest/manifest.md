We believe that we are currently experiencing immersion processes in digital technologies that can bring positive and negative impacts at the same time - that are rapidly reconfiguring our society as they advance in many areas and sectors.

We believe that many of these innovations are not promoting equity. It means that they are not generating more justice, promoting equal rights and opportunities for those who need them most. Moreover: they are not contributing in their fullness to a better and fairer world.

We understand that society needs more research focused on the progressive and regressive effects of these innovations on economics, sustainable development and democracy. All that in order to develop proposals that reconcile technological innovation with equity.

We want to take advantage of the windows of opportunity that these innovations are creating in the social, environmental, economic, political and cultural spheres and impact public policies, business practices and jurisprudence focused on generating more equity.

We adopt systemic thinking as a methodology for understanding and proposing changes in the direction mankind is taking when implementing disruptive technologies.
